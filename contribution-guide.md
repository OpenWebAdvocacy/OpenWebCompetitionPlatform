# Contribution Guide
Everyone is welcome to both contibute and comment.

Please check to make sure an issue has not already been created by searching the issues for relevant keywords. If an issue already exists and you believe you can meaningfully add to the conversation please add comments, constructive criticisms and whether you (or your organisation) supports or opposes the proposed change.

If you find a relevant issue that has already been closed, do not request to re-open it unless there is a new, relevant reason to do so

If no existing issue is found, then youâ€™re free to add a new one. The issue will provide a template that you should endeavour to complete as fully as possible. 

Issues that do not contain sufficient detail, are out of scope or break the code of conduct will be closed.

The system has labels to help with sorting, you can read about them [here].
