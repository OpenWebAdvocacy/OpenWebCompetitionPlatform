# Meetings
We believe in transparency and accountability. That's why we will conduct regular meetings (at a minimum monthly) to discuss the current key issues and to triage tickets. We want everyone to see how we work and how decisions are made.

## Joining the Conversation
Anyone can request to attend our meetings! Simply contact us at contactus@open-web-advocacy.org at least 1 day before the meeting date. We encourage pre-registration to help us plan accordingly. Once you're in, you'll be able to observe the proceedings and ask questions during designated times.

## Stay Informed, Stay Engaged
We keep you in the loop! You'll find a detailed schedule of upcoming meetings on our github, along with clear agendas outlining the topics, speakers, and discussion points. After each meeting, we publish minutes summarising key decisions, actions, and next steps.

## Respectful Dialogue, Welcoming Space
We strive to create a respectful and inclusive environment for everyone at our meetings. We expect all attendees to treat each other with courtesy and professional conduct. Please refrain from disruptive behaviour, as it can hinder productive dialogue.

## Your Voice Matters
We value your feedback! If you have questions about our meeting process, public participation, or document access, don't hesitate to contact us. We're always open to suggestions on how to improve transparency and engagement.

By keeping our meetings open and accessible, we aim to build trust with our stakeholders, foster collaboration, and demonstrate our commitment to serving the public good. We hope you'll join us in making Open Web Competition Platform a model of transparency and accountability.
