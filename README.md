# Open Web Competition Platform
**Open Web Competition Platform** is a repo for publically documenting and tracking issues related to browser and web competition. Its aim is to facilitate coordination between browser vendors, operating systems, developers, and industry to help document outstanding competition issues with an eye towards resolving them more quickly. 

Many browsers already have a long-standing tradition of engaging openly with their communities through public bug trackers. These channels have proven valuable for identifying and resolving issues, gathering user feedback, and fostering a sense of community around the development process. Extending this openness to the detailed engineering changes required to improve competition is a natural evolution of this existing practice, leveraging its benefits to further propel browser and web app competition.

**Our goal** is to moderate issues transparently and fairly, we understand that opinions may differ and some issues may be contentious. Constructive contributions that conform to the code of conduct and are within scope are welcome. 

### Scope
Issues should focus on:

- Fair and effective competition between browsers on all major operating systems
- Fair and effective competition between Web Apps and their native app counterparts on all major operating systems 
- Other competition issues that prevent the Web from competing

### Code of Conduct
All contributors and commenters agree to abide by our code of conduct, which you can [read in full here](code-of-conduct.md). 

### Moderation

This platform can be a powerful tool to improve competition. But just like any community, it needs some gentle guidance to stay focused and productive. That's where moderation comes in, not to stifle discussion, but to ensure everyone gets the most out of this shared space.

Our commitment is to moderate the system impartially, transparently and fairly. We respect that there will be a wide range of opinions on contentious issues. All issues that follow our code of conduct and are within scope are welcome.

You can read about our moderation policies [here](moderation.md).

### Updates
As the system is used and problems arise, we may alter aspects of templates, code of conduct, labels and processes. We acknowledge the importance of stability and predictability. However, we also recognize that progress necessitates evolution, and as such, reserve the right to modify the rules, templates, and internal processes that govern our issue tracker. This right is exercised not frivolously, but with a deep commitment to enhancing the platform's effectiveness and fostering an environment that prioritizes transparency, honesty and respect.

### Meetings
We believe in transparency and accountability. That's why we will conduct regular meetings (at a minimum monthly) to discuss the current key issues and to triage issues. We want everyone to see how we work and how decisions are made.

You can read about [meetings here](meetings.md) and see the [schedule here](schedule.md).
