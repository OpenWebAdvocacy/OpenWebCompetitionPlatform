# Moderation
This platform is a powerful tool to improve competition. But just like any community, it needs some gentle guidance to stay focused and productive. That's where moderation comes in, not to stifle discussion, but to ensure everyone gets the most out of this shared space.

We moderate for the following reasons:
- Positivity and Respect
> Moderation can address rude, disrespectful, or inflammatory comments. A positive and professional environment encourages productive collaboration and prevents conflicts.

- Scope
> Moderation helps ensure reported issues fall within the scope of the project. Irrelevant reports can clutter the tracker, making it harder to address relevant issues and reduce the value of the system overall for all parties.

- Template adherence
> Our project uses specific templates for issues. Moderation can ensure reports follow these templates. This is essential to make sure these issues are understandable, in scope and contain sufficient detail.

- Duplicates
> Moderation can identify and merge duplicate reports, reducing redundancy.

- Clarity
> Moderation can address unclear or poorly written reports. By requesting additional information or clarifying details, moderators ensure the issue is understandable.

- Staying on topic
> Moderation can steer discussions back to the reported issue and prevent irrelevant tangents. This keeps the focus on finding solutions and prevents the tracker from becoming a forum for general discussion.

- Spam and abuse
> Moderation can filter out spam, phishing attempts, and other malicious content.

Our commitment is to moderate the system impartially, transparently and fairly. We respect that there will be a wide range of opinions on contentious issues. All tickets that follow our code of conduct and are within scope are welcome.
