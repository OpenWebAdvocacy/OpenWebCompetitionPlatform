# Label Guide

The Open Web Competition Platform issue tracker uses a variety of labels to correctly collect issues together for easier tracking. You may add any labels you feel are correct when posting, but a moderator may choose to edit the labels to recategorise if inaccurately set. 

Labels are divided into the following groups:

- Status
  > Each issue will have a status to track its progress
  - Triage
    > A new issue that has been added to the system, needs to be checked by moderators for [scope](scope.md), [quality](contribution-guide.md) and adherence to [code of conduct](code-of-conduct.md).
  - Open
    > Open for discussion
  - Completed
    > Requestor has agreed to complete ticket as requirements have been met. If another supporting party disagrees they may duplicate the issue with a link to the original issue and an explanation.
  - Rejected
    > Closed because issue is [out of scope](scope.md), violation of [code of conduct](code-of-conduct.md), [insufficient detail](contribution-guide.md) etc
  - Withdrawn
    > The issue has been closed for other reasons such as the requester has upon discusion with the requestee decided that it is unnecessary. An issue being withdrawn does not prevent other parties from lodging the same issue, with a link to the original ticket.
- To \[Organization\] Label
  > This label is used to flag which organisation would be responsible for the change
- Support: \[Organization\]
  > These labels indicate that the organisation in general supports this issue and the remedies proposed, a more nuanced explanation can be added in comments 
  > Please do not set support labels for organisations unless you work for the organisation **and have permission to do so**.
- Platform Label
  > This label is to indicate which platform the issue is on, for example an operating system.
- No Response
  > This label is to indicate that the requestee has not meaningfully responded to the request in a perscribed amount of time. Responding can include stating reasons for declining to impliment the request.
- Priority
  > This label is to indicate the highest priority this issue has out of the supporting parties, this is useful if requesters have many issues. Other parties may indicate what they believe the priority is by commenting on the issue. A short explanation as to the reasoning behind the priority is required.


Additional labels could be added in future as the system evolves, please contact us if you think of any that maybe useful.
