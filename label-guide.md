# Label Guide

The Open Web Competition Platform issue tracker uses a variety of labels to correctly collect issues together for easier tracking. You may add any labels you feel are correct when posting, but a moderator may choose to edit the labels to recategorise if inaccurately set. 

Labels are divided into the following groups:

- To Organization Label
> This label is used to flag which organisation would be responsible for the change
- Support
> These labels indicate that the organisation in general supports this issue and the remedies proposed, a more nuanced explanation can be added in comments 
> Please do not set support labels for organisations unless you work for the organisation and have permission to do so.
- Oppose
> These labels indicate that the organisation in general does not support this issue and the remedies proposed, a more nuanced explanation can be added in comments 
> Please do not set oppose labels for organisations unless you work for the organisation and have permission to do so.

Additional labels could be added in future as the system evolves.
